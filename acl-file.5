ACL-FILE(5)                 File Formats Manual                 ACL-FILE(5)

NAME
       acl-file - Format for defining AWS network ACL rules

SYNOPSIS
       The acl-file format specifies inbound and outbound rules for an
       AWS Network ACL (NACL) in a text format. It is designed to be
       easily parsed by scripts or tools managing NACL configurations.

DESCRIPTION
       The file is divided into sections, each starting with a header
       indicating the direction of traffic. The two possible headers
       are:

       [inbound]
              Specifies rules for inbound traffic to resources in the
              subnet.

       [outbound]
              Specifies rules for outbound traffic from resources in
              the subnet.

       Each section contains one or more rules, defined line by line.
       Each rule must specify the following fields in the given order:

              rule_number protocol port_range cidr_block action

FIELDS
       rule_number
              An integer that uniquely identifies the rule and
              determines the order of evaluation. Lower numbers are
              evaluated first.

       protocol
              The network protocol for the rule. Specify one of the
              following:
              - tcp: Transmission Control Protocol
              - udp: User Datagram Protocol
              - icmp: Internet Control Message Protocol
              - all: All protocols (equivalent to "-1" in AWS)

       port_range
              Specifies the port or range of ports the rule applies to.
              Use a single integer for a specific port (e.g., 22) or a
              range in the format "start-end" (e.g., 1024-65535). For
              "all" protocols, use "-" to indicate no port restriction.

       cidr_block
              The IP address range in CIDR notation (e.g.,
              192.168.1.0/24) that the rule applies to.

       action
              The action for matching traffic. Must be one of:
              - allow: Allow the traffic
              - deny: Deny the traffic

EXAMPLES
       Example of a complete ACL file:

       [inbound]
       100 tcp 22 10.1.0.0/16 allow
       200 tcp 22 0.0.0.0/0 deny
       300 all - 0.0.0.0/0 allow
       400 all - 0.0.0.0/0 deny

       [outbound]
       100 tcp 22 10.1.0.0/16 allow
       200 tcp 22 0.0.0.0/0 deny
       300 tcp 1024-65535 0.0.0.0/0 allow
       400 all - 0.0.0.0/0 deny

NOTES
       - Rules within each section are evaluated in ascending order of
         rule_number.
       - CIDR blocks must be valid and comply with AWS requirements.
       - Port ranges must be valid integers, or "-" for protocols that
         do not use ports.
